# 📁 How to Stop a Folder or File from Being Tracked in Git

If you've added a folder (like `/publish`) to `.gitignore` but it still appears on GitHub, here's what you need to know and do.

> ⚠️ Simply adding a file or folder to `.gitignore` **won't remove it from Git** if it was already committed. You must manually untrack it.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Untrack the Folder or File in Git**

Use the following command:

```bash
git rm -r --cached <folder-or-file-name>
```

🔍 Example:

```bash
git rm -r --cached publish
```

* `--cached` removes it from Git’s index (not your local files)
* `-r` ensures folders are handled recursively

---

### 2. **Commit the Change**

```bash
git commit -m "Remove folder from Git tracking"
```

---

### 3. **Push to Remote Repository (e.g., GitHub)**

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

## ✅ Confirm the Folder is No Longer Tracked

* Visit your GitHub repository
* The specified folder or file should no longer be visible
* Future changes in that folder will now be ignored thanks to `.gitignore`

---

## 📄 Sample `.gitignore` Entry

To ensure the folder remains ignored, include it in `.gitignore` like this:

```
# Ignore deployment or output folders
/publish/
```

Happy cleaning! 🧹
