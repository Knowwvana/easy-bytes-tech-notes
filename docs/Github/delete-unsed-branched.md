## üìå Notes

* Never delete a branch directly from remote unless you're sure it‚Äôs not needed.
* `-d` vs `-D`: `-d` is safe (only deletes merged), `-D` is forceful.
* Always switch to a different branch (e.g., `main`) before deleting another branch.

---

## üîç Example

Assume you're working on branch `feature/cleanup-ui` and it's no longer needed.

```bash
git checkout main               # Switch to main

# Delete local branch safely
git branch -d feature/cleanup-ui

# OR force delete if unmerged
git branch -D feature/cleanup-ui

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/cleanup-ui

# Clean up local tracking
git fetch -p
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Name branches meaningfully (`feature/login-api`, `fix/null-checks`).
* Delete merged branches regularly.
* Document closed branches in PRs if needed.
