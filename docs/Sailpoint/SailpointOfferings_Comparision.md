## 🔄 IdentityNow: Evolution and Integration into Identity Security Cloud

For those familiar with **SailPoint IdentityNow**, you may wonder how it fits into SailPoint’s current offerings. IdentityNow, introduced about a decade ago as a cloud-based identity governance solution, has evolved significantly and is now a core component of **SailPoint Identity Security Cloud (ISC)**. Here’s what you need to know:

- **Rebranding to Identity Security Cloud**: IdentityNow has been rebranded as part of **Identity Security Cloud**, reflecting its transformation into a comprehensive, AI-powered, cloud-native platform. While IdentityNow initially focused on single sign-on (SSO) and password management, ISC now encompasses advanced features like AI-driven recommendations, cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), and non-human identity governance.[](https://www.sailpoint.com/blog/sailpoint-identity-security-cloud-most-common-questions)[](https://cybersectrainings.com/sailpoint-identity-iq-vs-sailpoint-identity-now/)
- **Where to Find IdentityNow Features**:
  - **Standard Suite**: IdentityNow’s core capabilities (e.g., access requests, certifications, SSO, password management) are included in the **ISC Standard** suite, ideal for organizations starting their identity security journey.
  - **Business Suite**: Adds advanced AI for role modeling and compliance, building on IdentityNow’s automation and scalability.
  - **Business Plus Suite**: Incorporates IdentityNow’s cloud-native architecture with CIEM, non-human identity management, and optional modules like NERM and FAM for complex environments.
- **Key Enhancements**:
  - **AI and ML**: Since 2017, IdentityNow’s capabilities have been enhanced with patented AI for access recommendations, risk analysis, and role creation, now standard across ISC suites.[](https://www.saasworthy.com/product/sailpoint-identitynow)
  - **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Built on a multi-tenant microservices platform, ISC (including IdentityNow) offers scalability, zero downtime, and automatic updates.[](https://cybersectrainings.com/sailpoint-identity-iq-vs-sailpoint-identity-now/)[](https://edgile.com/identity-and-access-management/sailpointidn/)
  - **Integration**: IdentityNow’s connectors and APIs are now part of ISC’s extensive library, supporting hybrid and cloud environments.[](https://www.applytosupply.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/104439474223294)
- **For IdentityNow Users**: If you’re currently using IdentityNow, you’re already leveraging ISC’s foundation. Upgrading to a higher ISC tier (Business or Business Plus) unlocks advanced features, while existing workflows (e.g., provisioning, certifications) remain seamless. Check the [SailPoint SaaS Updates Blog](https://community.sailpoint.com/t5/SaaS-Updates-Blog/bg-p/saas-updates) for the latest enhancements.[](https://community.sailpoint.com/t5/Customer-Success-Engineering-FAQ/Where-can-we-find-information-on-what-s-new-or-upcoming-in/ta-p/236235)
- **Migration from IdentityIQ**: For IdentityIQ users considering a move to the cloud, ISC (built on IdentityNow) offers a streamlined migration path with tools like the SailPoint ISC Upgrade Assessment Program to evaluate gaps and benefits.[](https://www.sailpoint.com/blog/sailpoint-identity-security-cloud-most-common-questions)[](https://www.integralpartnersllc.com/iam-services/sailpoint-identityiq-vs-identitynow-evaluation-and-migration-analysis/)

This evolution ensures that IdentityNow’s simplicity and cloud-first design are preserved while offering enterprise-grade scalability and advanced security within ISC.
